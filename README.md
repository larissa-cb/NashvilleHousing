## Why data cleaning is important?

Data cleaning, or the process of ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and usable, is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and redundancies in data to improve its quality and reliability. This meticulous process is essential because it directly impacts the accuracy of insights and decisions derived from the data. Clean data leads to better analytics, which in turn can significantly enhance decision-making processes. With clean data, businesses can make informed decisions, gain a competitive edge, and foster trust with their clients by providing reliable and actionable insights.
